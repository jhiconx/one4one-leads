The positioning around ease, flavor, and getting shrimp into the weekly rotation feels like a strong fit for college students who want something fast but still premium.\n\nWe run a sampling network focused on Gen Z across major college campuses. Everything is verified by phone number so each sample is tied to a unique student, and brands only pay on verified redemptions (no duplicates, no recycled samples, no inflated counts).\n\nIf you’re interested in testing Prime Shrimp with college students – especially around quick at-home meals and freezer-friendly proteins – I’d be happy to share how we handle distribution, verification, and reporting.\n\nWould you be open to a quick conversation?\n\nBest,\nJonas",
