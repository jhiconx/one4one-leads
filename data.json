There are no upfront fees or placement costs.\n\nIf exploring a campus-driven push for Flirt is on your radar, I’d be glad to share how this system works.\n\nBest,\nJonas",

We run a verified Gen Z sampling network across major college campuses, where every sample is tied to a unique student phone number. If you ever explore college-driven trial for Flirt, I'd be glad to share how our verification system works."
