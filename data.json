There are no upfront fees or placement costs.\n\nIf exploring a campus-driven push for Flirt is on your radar, I’d be glad to share how this system works.\n\nBest,\nJonas",

Everything is verified by phone number so each sample is tied to a unique student, and brands only pay on verified redemptions (no duplicates, no recycled samples, no inflated counts).\n\nIf you’re interested in testing Prime Shrimp with college students – especially around quick at-home meals and freezer-friendly proteins – I’d be happy to share how we handle distribution, verification, and reporting.\n\nWould you be open to a quick conversation?\n\nBest,\nJonas",
