There are no upfront fees or placement costs.\n\nIf exploring a campus-driven push for Flirt is on your radar, I’d be glad to share how this system works.\n\nBest,\nJonas",

The positioning around ease, flavor, and getting shrimp into the weekly rotation feels like a strong fit for college students who want something fast but still premium.\n\nWe run a sampling network focused on Gen Z across major college campuses. Everything is verified by phone number so each sample is tied to a unique student, and brands only pay on verified redemptions (no duplicates, no recycled samples, no inflated counts).\n\nIf you’re interested in testing Prime Shrimp with college students – especially around quick at-home meals and freezer-friendly proteins – I’d be happy to share how we handle distribution, verification, and reporting.\n\nWould you be open to a quick conversation?\n\nBest,\nJonas",
